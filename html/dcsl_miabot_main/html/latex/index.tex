{\bfseries dcsl\-\_\-miabot\-\_\-main} 

\-This package only contains launch files for the \-D\-C\-S\-L \-Miabot platform.

\-The miabot\-\_\-follower.\-launch file launches a demostration where the robot connected on /dev/rfcomm0 is controlled by a joystick and the robot on /dev/rfcomm1 follows the first robot under closed loop control.

\-The miabot\-\_\-main.\-launch file launches the whole system including the \-M\-A\-T\-L\-A\-B interface. \-This file currently needs to be manually editted to direct how many robots to connect and which serial ports they are connected to.
