{\bfseries dcsl\-\_\-high\-\_\-level\-\_\-control} 

\-This package provides \char`\"{}high level control\char`\"{} for planar robots. \-The dcsl\-\_\-miabot\-\_\-follower\-\_\-control node implements an algorithm to cause robots to follow or 'chase' one another. \-The \-C++ library dcsl\-\_\-miabot\-\_\-high\-\_\-level\-\_\-math provides the control law for that node.

\-Launchfiles are also included to create ipc-\/bridge nodes that allow control algorithms written in \-Matlab to be called from \-R\-O\-S. \-Sample \-Matlab node and control law files are included within the matlab folder. \-Issues with installation of ipc-\/bridge have kept us from testing that functionality.\section{\-R\-O\-S A\-P\-I}\label{index_rosapi}
