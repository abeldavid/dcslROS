description: "\n\n     The dcsl_miabot_driver package contains the dcsl_miabot_driver.py\
  \ node and the dcsl_miabot_joy node. The former subscribes to the cmd_vel topic\
  \ with Twist messages, translates these into wheel speed commands, and sends them\
  \ to the robot over a serial connection. The later subscribes to the joy topic and\
  \ translates the joystick commands into velocities and angular velocities for the\
  \ Miabot PRO which are published as Twist messages on the cmd_vel topic.\n\n  "
