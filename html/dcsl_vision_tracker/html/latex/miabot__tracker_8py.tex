\-A node that subscribes to the /camera/image\-\_\-raw topic with \-Image messages, uses \-Open\-C\-V to find the poses of the robots in the images, and publishes the poses of the robots as a \-Pose\-Array.

\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
\-A node that subscribes to the /camera/image\-\_\-raw topic with \-Image messages, uses \-Open\-C\-V to find the poses of the robots in the images, and publishes the poses of the robots as a \-Pose\-Array. \-It also subscribes to the state\-\_\-estimate topic (\-Pose\-Array messages) so that the published \-Pose\-Array maintains the same order as the state\-\_\-estimate. \-It matches the detected robots with the estimated poses using the \-Hungarian algorithm via the munkres library. \-This node will soon be depricated in favor of a node based on the dcsl\-\_\-vision\-\_\-tracker\-\_\-\-A\-P\-I which is under development.
