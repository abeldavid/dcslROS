steps taken to try to install ipc-bridge on auvlab imac:

latest attempt is stored in ~/ros_user_stacks
previous versions were moved to ~/unused\ ros\ stacks

First attempt, followed the guide on 
https://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~meam620/wiki/index.php?n=Roslab.IpcBridge

To get this to work, had to use technique from
http://answers.ros.org/question/45838/error-when-installing-ipc-bridge-for-ros-and-matlab/
where you change last line in ipc_bridge_ros.mk to

$(CXX) -I./include $(ROS_CXXFLAGS) $(IPC_BRIDGE_CXXFLAGS) -lstdc++ $(IPC_LFLAGS) -lipc $(ROS_LFLAGS) $(ROS_LIBS) $^ -o bin/$@ -lroscpp -lrosconsole -lroscpp_serialization -lipc

With that, the example programs run fine, but trying to replicate that with PoseArray message leads to segfault in matlab.



Next, tried to follow this guide to install ipc-bridge from github
http://bolt-haptics.seas.upenn.edu/index.php/Software/Matlab-ROS-IPC-Bridge

It involved installing IPC library manually, (and in the process needed to apt-get install "bison" and "flex" commands). Once all was compiled, nodes crashed upon launch, so I reverted to the previous ipc-bridge installation procedure.

Then there was a message about not being able to find libipc.so, so I followed this guide:
cutler.mit.edu/2011/10/ros-matlab-bridge-installation

Somewhere along the way, I followed these instructions to change matlab's symlinks for libstdc++.so.6 to point to the system versions:

Next step should probably be recompiling ROS with different boost headers compatible with matlab, as described here:
